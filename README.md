Portfolio project for Computer Architecture and Assembly Course

This program receives 10 integer inputs from the user up to numbers too large or too 
small to fit in 32 bits. It then displays the list of inputs, their sum, and their truncated average.
String inputs are converted to integers before being converted back to strings upon being displayed.
